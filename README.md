Practical course: modeling, simulation, optimization

This page contains the material for a practical course on modeling, simulation, and optimization that I prepared for a 
course at the Friedrich-Alexander Universit√§t Erlangen-Nuremberg in the summer semester 2021. This course provides a 
practical introduction to some of the most commonly used discretization methods for PDEs (finite differences and 
finite elements) and their implementation in matlab. It also covers some of the basics of gradient-based optimization 
focused on the numerical solution of (PDE-constrained) optimal control problems. Some basic programming skills in matlab 
or a similar programming language is recommended but not required. 

The course material is structured into 12 weeks. For each week, you can find the lecture slides (pdf), 
a related matlab exercise (pdf), and a starting point for the matlab code (.m). 

The 12 lectures are structured into three parts of 4 lectures each. 
The different parts can be studied largely independent, but sometimes rely on previously covered topics. 
In particular the material on time discretization from lecture 3 in part 1 also plays an important role in the other parts.

For each of the three part there is a bonus exercise. The bonus questions are significantly more advanced than the other 
exercises and they do not always come with a starting point for the matlab code.

o	Lecture 8: Beam models (lectures slides, exercise, matlab files)
Part III: Optimization (bonus question, matlab files)
o	Lecture 9: Optimization and gradient descent (lectures slides, exercise, matlab files)
o	Lecture 10: Hessians and step size selection (lectures slides, exercise, matlab files)
o	Lecture 11: Dynamic optimal control (lectures slides, exercise, matlab files)
o	Lecture 12: Control of neural ODEs (lectures slides, exercise, matlab files)
